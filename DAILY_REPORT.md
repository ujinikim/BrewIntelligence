# BrewIntelligence: Engineering Daily Report
**Date:** January 16, 2026
**Status:** PRODUCTION READY 🚀

## 🏗️ 1. Architecture & Infrastructure
- **Environment Unification**: Consolidated multiple virtual environments into a single root `venv`.
- **Command Center**: Implemented a `Makefile` for one-touch setup (`make setup`), development (`make dev`), and scraping (`make scrape`).
- **Autonomous Operations**: Configured `opencode.json` for seamless agentic workflow.
- **Database**: Fully migrated from static CSV to **Supabase Vector DB** (PostgreSQL + pgvector).

## 🕷️ 2. Data Intelligence Pipeline
- **Smart Scraper**: Enhanced Python scraper to extract rich metadata:
  - Roast Levels, Roaster Location, and detailed sensory scores (Aroma, Acidity, Body, Flavor).
  - Automated Vectorization using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions).
- **Scale**: Increased database from 5 demo records to ~500+ real expert reviews.
- **Auto-Sync**: Background processes now ensure UI reflects live database growth.

## 🧠 3. AI-Powered Features
### **The Flavor Explorer**
- Semantic discovery engine that understands descriptive natural language.
- Displays **Match Percentages** for every result.
- Visual **Flavor Bar Charts** for quick sensory assessment.

### **Market Trend Intelligence**
- API-driven keyword frequency analysis on the latest reviews.
- Live "Trending Flavor" card on the dashboard with a "Champion Bean" recommendation.

### **The Coffee Alchemist (NEW)**
- **Vector Arithmetic Lab**: Perform math on taste.
- Example: `Ethiopia + Chocolate - Acidity = ?`
- Discovers coffees at the mathematical intersection of different flavor profiles.

## 🎨 4. Premium UI/UX & Visual Storytelling
- **Design System Revamp**: Refined "Cream & Coffee" palette using Tailwind CSS v4 with custom glassmorphism and motion utility classes.
- **The Alchemist Experience**:
  - Implemented an animated "Alchemist" character that responds to user actions.
  - **Dynamic Expressions**: Eyes blink, glow, and change shape based on workbench state (idle, adding reagents, transmuting, success).
  - **Interactive Lab**: Beaker visually fills as formula complexity increases and shakes during the transmutation phase.
- **Modern Shell**: Implemented a sticky, glass-morphic navigation with active state tracking and icon-driven routing.

## 🔍 5. Verification Proof
- **Build Status**: 0 errors.
- **Integration**: All widgets (Price Chart, Hidden Gems, Trend Card) are live and data-populated.
- **Aesthetics**: Verified via Playwright screenshots (Modern Typography, Glassmorphism, Responsive Grid).

## 🔧 6. Data Integrity & Maintenance
- **Text De-Noising**: Automated cleanup of scraped review text, removing junk metadata like location labels and Agtron codes from the content fields.
- **Local Resilience**: The scraper now maintains a local `scraped_reviews.csv` backup in addition to syncing with Supabase.
- **Robustness**: Rewrote the scraping logic to target specific HTML structures rather than relying on global text extraction.
- **Maintenance Scripts**: Added `cleanup_db.py` and `fix_data.py` to the engineering toolkit for retroactive data polishing.
