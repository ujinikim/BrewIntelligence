Blind Assessment
A deep bottom with just enough acidity to keep from the coffee from imploding into dullness. Other than the rather full body I read few signs of the Colombia profile in this decent but hardly exciting coffee.
Notes
A decent but hardly exciting coffee with some acidity and a deep bottom. Pre-ground and canned. Grind is finer than most others in the cupping. Twelve-ounce can $3.29, or $4.39 per pound.
Who Should Drink It Not sure. The can is not old-fashioned enough to excite nostalgia, the price not cheap enough to constitute a bargain, and the coffee not Colombian enough to interest enthusiasts. maybe aficionados trapped in a very small town with no specialty stores.Explore Similar CoffeesClick here for more reviews from Yuban Coffee Company
